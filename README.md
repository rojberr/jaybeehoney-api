# JAYBEEHONEY-API

This is an interactive shop site, where you can buy honey related things.

Made by me, mostly for me. One day we may go live, cause my family owns a bee-garden.

# Usage ðŸ’¡

This API is responsible for eCommerce webshop BACKEND.
To use it you can send requests at the host :point_right: [https://jaybeehoney-api.herokuapp.com/](https://jaybeehoney-api.herokuapp.com/) 
**Please remember that this API is not meant to be used with your browser**  

Try (Heroku free tier apps sleep after 30 minutes of inactivity and need a minute to wake up): 
```bash
curl -X POST https://jaybeehoney-api.herokuapp.com/init  
```

Feel free to edit it and use it for your own eCommerce website. ðŸ›’
Functions like ordering are already included!

## Postgres Database

This web application uses **local / Heroku** Postgres Database.

This API automatically connects to the local PostgreSQL using **Spring Profiles**.
When it gets deployed to Heroku it will use **prod profile** connecting to **Heroku PostgreSQL database**.

To run it locally, use:

1) cd docker (to get inside of /docker/ folder)
```bash
cd docker
```
2) docker-compose up -d (to run our database configured in docker-compose.yml)
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```
3) Open the API in your favorite IDE (I suggest IntelliJ ðŸ¤– ) and run it!
4) The connection ðŸ”— will be established automatically using env from __docker-compose.yml__ 

## Swagger - API Documentation

Another dependency was added, and not Swagger Honey API documentation can be accessed after launching the application
